* Uses the [louvain package](https://github.com/vtraag/louvain-igraph) to determine communities.

Prerequisites
=============

* [Python 2.7.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - later Python 2.7 versions will likely also work, but this is the last Python version tested.
* [python-igraph](http://igraph.org/python/)
* [Pycairo](http://igraph.org/python/doc/tutorial/install.html#installing-igraph)
* [louvain](https://github.com/vtraag/louvain-igraph)

Using the GUI
=============

* Open the GUI by running the file open_gui.py in the top-level folder using Python 2.7.
